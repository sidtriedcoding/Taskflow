## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Full CRUD Functionality:** A complete suite of RESTful API endpoints for all core entities, allowing users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete projects, tasks, teams, and user profiles.
-   **Relational Data Modeling:** A well-designed PostgreSQL schema managed by Prisma, establishing clear relationships between users, teams, projects, and tasks to ensure data integrity.
-   **Task Management:** Create tasks with detailed attributes such as status (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress"), priority, tags, and start/due dates.
-   **User & Team Assignments:** Assign tasks to specific users and projects to teams, creating a clear structure of ownership.
-   **API Validation:** The backend includes robust validation for all incoming data, preventing common issues like invalid date formats or missing required fields.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the backend server up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
-   npm or yarn
-   PostgreSQL
-   Git

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/taskflow-project.git](https://github.com/your-username/taskflow-project.git)
    cd taskflow-project/server
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    -   Create a new file named `.env` in the `server` directory.
    -   Add your database connection string to this file. Replace the placeholders with your actual credentials.
    ```env
    # .env
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/YOUR_DATABASE_NAME?schema=public"
    ```

4.  **Run the database migrations:**
    This command will create all the necessary tables in your database based on the `schema.prisma` file.
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev
    ```

5.  **Seed the database:**
    This command will populate your database with initial sample data.
    ```bash
    npx prisma db seed
    ```

6.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev 
    ```
    The server should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:8000`.
