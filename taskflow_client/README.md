## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Full CRUD Functionality:** A complete suite of RESTful API endpoints for all core entities, allowing users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete projects, tasks, teams, and user profiles.
- **Relational Data Modeling:** A well-designed PostgreSQL schema managed by Prisma, establishing clear relationships between users, teams, projects, and tasks to ensure data integrity.
- **Task Management:** Create tasks with detailed attributes such as status (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress"), priority, tags, and start/due dates.
- **User & Team Assignments:** Assign tasks to specific users and projects to teams, creating a clear structure of ownership.
- **API Validation:** The backend includes robust validation for all incoming data, preventing common issues like invalid date formats or missing required fields.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the backend server up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL
- Git

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/taskflow-project.git](https://github.com/your-username/taskflow-project.git)
    cd taskflow-project/server
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    - Create a new file named `.env` in the `server` directory.
    - Add your database connection string to this file. Replace the placeholders with your actual credentials.

    ```env
    # .env
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/YOUR_DATABASE_NAME?schema=public"
    ```

4.  **Run the database migrations:**
    This command will create all the necessary tables in your database based on the `schema.prisma` file.

    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev
    ```

5.  **Seed the database:**
    This command will populate your database with initial sample data.

    ```bash
    npx prisma db seed
    ```

6.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The server should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:8000`.

## üîå API Endpoints

Here are the main API endpoints that have been implemented:

| Method | Endpoint                | Description                                 |
| :----- | :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/projects`             | Retrieves a list of all projects.           |
| `POST` | `/projects`             | Creates a new project.                      |
| `GET`  | `/tasks`                | Retrieves a list of all tasks.              |
| `GET`  | `/tasks?projectId={id}` | Retrieves all tasks for a specific project. |
| `POST` | `/tasks`                | Creates a new task.                         |

_More endpoints for users, teams, etc., can be added here as they are developed._

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
